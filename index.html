			<h2>Welcome to my ePortfolio</h2>
			<p>My name is Chandler Rose and this is my ePortfolio. This website showcases my work and achievements, including projects I have completed, my resume, and research. I created this website to showcase my skills and experience to potential employers and to share my journey with others.</p>
			<p>I am a cybersecurity professional with five years of experience setting up and securing networks in the military. Through my work, education, and certifications, I have developed a strong set of skills in offensive security.</p>
			<p>Please take a look at my projects and resume to learn more about my background and experience. You can also visit the WhoAmI page or my LinkedIn profile to verify my achievements. If you have any questions or would like to contact me, please visit my contact page to get in touch.</p>
